rhandsontable 0.2
-------------------------

* Upgraded to handsontable 0.15.1

* Improved mapping between R classes and handsontable column types.  Factors are now
  mapped as dropdown columns (#30).

* Numeric cells are now formatted as '0' for integers and '0.00' for numeric
  columns.  See http://http://numeraljs.com/ for more details on formatting options.

* Sparking charts (http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/) can now be added to the
  table.  See the project page for examples and thanks to the sparkline package and
  Ramnath Vaidyanathan for inspiration.

* Display NA values as blank cells in the table.  This requires changing some colums
  to character when passing to handsontable and may require special handling in some
  cases (e.g. Date columns).  See the examples on the project page.  Thanks to
  Melanie Bacou for the suggestion.

* Set overflow: auto and specified a default height in shiny (#21)

* Added a project page at http://jrowen.github.io/rhandsontable
